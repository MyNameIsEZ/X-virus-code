# X-virus-code
Here is the source code for a simple virus script I wrote. The code is in Batch language and runs through CMD. Unfortunately this virus only works on Windows so far, but I am working on a MacOS and Linux version. 
Don't be fooled by this virus. It may be simple, but it's dangerous! It is undetectable by antivirus and has Ghost features. DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR OWN DEVICES AND SYSTEMS! This virus shuts the target system down and deletes all files and programs required to boot up again. I originally got the idea from a website, but that was a while back and I can't remember the link. If I find the link I will reference it. I have modified the code a bit so that it caters to my needs. *So basically put short this virus kills the target system* 

*NOTE* I take no responsibility for any damage or trouble caused by the use of this code. What you choose to do with this code is up to you and not my responsibility. 

If you have any questions regarding the virus or anything else feel free to contact me via Twitter (twitter.com/QUITE_EZ) or via email (mayanstegmann123@gmail.com). I am quite responsive so you should recieve a speedy reply if you contact me.
